## Overview

AGIL Ops Hub is a comprehensive development platform for command and control systems designed to accelerate the
development of operational-level applications. Built on a modern microservice architecture, it provides a robust
foundation with numerous out-of-the-box capabilities, allowing developers to focus on building domain-specific features
rather than reinventing common infrastructure components.

AGIL Ops Hub is designed with modularity and flexibility at its core:

-   **Microservice Architecture** - Leverages containerized microservices for scalability and resilience
-   **API-First Approach** - All functionality is accessible via well-defined APIs
-   **Modularity** - Capabilities are published as separate modules which can be used and extended separately

## Getting Started
