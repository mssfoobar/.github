AGIL Ops Hub is a comprehensive development platform for command and control systems designed to accelerate the development of operational-level applications.

It provides a robust foundation with numerous out-of-the-box capabilities, allowing developers to focus on building domain-specific features rather than reinventing common infrastructure components.

## Key Features

-   **Microservice Architecture**: Leverages containerized microservices for scalability and resilience.
-   **API-First Approach**: All functionality is accessible via well-defined APIs.
-   **Modularity**: Capabilities are published as separate modules that can be used and extended independently.
-   **Reusable Workflows**: Standardized CI/CD workflows for building, testing, and deploying applications.
